Introduction
============

birds-eye is a BizHawk external tool + python library, giving a (hopefully) convenient interface for python 
scripts to communicate with the BizHawk emulator.

This library is VERY bares bones at the moment, with only the current features available:

* Connecting to the external tool
* Retrieving memory data from the external tool
* Sending inputs to be executed in the emulator
* Retrieving the current framecount

I plan on adding a lot more as I continue to use this library myself.

This is the first project I've made with the intent of others using it, so any kind of suggestion 
would be incredibly helpful.

Thank you :]
